abstract = "Given a model of the polymorphic typed lambda calculus based upon a Cartesian closed category K, there will be functors from K to K whose action on objects can be expressed by type expressions and whose action on morphisms can be expressed by ordinary expressions. We show that if T is such a functor then there is a weak initial T-algebra and if, in addition, K possesses equalizers of all subsets of its morphism sets, then there is an initial T-algebra. These results are used to establish the impossibility of certain models, including those in which types denote sets and S → S′ denotes the set of all functions from S to S′."

This chapter presents an exposition of certain themes in proof theory. The chapter discusses ideas behind what may be called Gentzen-type analysis in proof theory, where in particular, one wants to draw attention to the fact that they constitute the embryo to a general proof theory; extensions of the results obtained by Gentzen to more powerful theories; and the connection between proofs and the terms used in functional interpretations of intuitionistic logic, in particular, the connection between Gentzen-type analysis and the Gödel-type analysis that originated with Godel's socalled Dialectica interpretation. A notion of validity of derivations is presented that may be contemplated as a possible explication of Gentzen's ideas about an operational interpretation of the logical constants. Proofs of the results have shown how this notion of validity may be used as a convenient tool to establish the main result about strong normalization in first order logic."
